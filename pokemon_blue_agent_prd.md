# Product Requirements Document (PRD) – Mistral-Powered Autonomous Pokémon Blue Agent

## Executive Summary

This document defines a Mistral AI agent designed to play **Pokémon Blue** end-to-end without human assistance. The agent integrates a Game Boy emulator (PyBoy) with the Mistral API, a RAM-based game state extractor, and a sophisticated prompt and context management system.

**Primary Goal:** Defeat the Pokémon League autonomously while maintaining robustness, efficiency, and transparency.

Unlike streaming-focused approaches, this PRD prioritizes:

- Core gameplay control  
- Accurate memory mapping  
- Intelligent decision-making  
- Long-term game planning

The project builds upon existing plans (deployment plan, implementation plan, improvement recommendations, and performance options) and incorporates research on RAM mapping, structured outputs, vision support, and lessons from agentic case studies like *Gemini Plays Pokémon*.

## Background & Research

### Legal and Technical Constraints

- **ROM Legality:** Pokémon Blue is copyrighted. Players must own a physical cartridge and supply a dumped ROM.  
- **Mistral API:** Accepts multimodal inputs and supports structured JSON outputs.  
- **Memory Mapping:** Automation depends on accessing key Game Boy RAM addresses.  
- **Harness Lessons:** Text-extracted RAM plus a fog-of-war map is more informative than raw pixels.

### Review of Existing Documents

- **CRUSH.md:** Coding guidelines, uv environment management, PEP 8, and secret handling.
- **Deployment-plan.md:** Architecture overview with PyBoy, Mistral API, and SQLite logging.
- **Implementation-plan.md:** Step-by-step strategy for emulator integration and API setup.
- **Improvement Recommendations:** Identifies missing FSM, inaccurate RAM addresses, and performance issues.
- **Performance Options:** Frame skipping and selective screenshot capture.

### External Insights

- Gemini summarises context every 100 actions and compresses every 1000.
- Original autonomous runs took ~813 hours, improved to ~406 hours.
- RAM overlays are critical for reliable state reading.

## User Persona

- **AI Developer/Researcher:** Needs modular code, metrics collection, and adjustable memory maps.
- **Hobbyist Player:** Wants to watch the AI play locally without complex streaming setups.

## Functional Requirements

### Core Gameplay Control

- **Emulator Integration:** Use PyBoy in visual or headless mode. Validate ROM checksum.
- **Memory Mapping Module:** Define constants for RAM addresses (position, map, party, battle flags, etc.).
- **Finite State Machine (FSM):** Define states (e.g., `TITLE_SCREEN`, `BATTLE`, `MENU`) and detect them from memory.
- **State Capture:** Capture RAM snapshots and optional screenshots at intervals.
- **Prompt Management:** Compose system prompts with badges, context, history, and goals. Summarise every 100 turns.
- **Model Interaction:** Use Mistral’s JSON mode with schema validation and fallback parsing.
- **Action Execution:** Translate actions to PyBoy inputs and log results.
- **Goal Management:** Maintain structured goals with contingency plans.
- **Error Handling:** Implement retries, safe fallbacks, and checkpoints.

### Monitoring & Data Collection

- **Database Logging:** Use SQLite for actions, events, stats, and summaries.
- **Dashboard:** Streamlit dashboard showing current state, timeline, and metrics.
- **Metrics Collection:** Record CPU, memory, API call rates, and errors.

### Optional Streaming

- Capture video with FFmpeg for review or optional livestreaming.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Reliability:** Continuous operation for ≥48 hours with automatic restarts.
- **Performance:** ≥10× game speed during headless execution.
- **Modularity:** Clearly separated modules for emulator, memory, FSM, prompt management, and logging.
- **Security & Privacy:** Use environment variables for API keys and validate ROMs.
- **Portability:** Docker containers for Linux and Mac.
- **Extensibility:** Support new tools, models, and future games.

## High-Level Architecture

1. **Emulator Layer:** PyBoy provides memory access and input control.  
2. **Memory Map & State Detector:** Defines RAM constants and classifies state.  
3. **Prompt Manager:** Builds and manages game context prompts.  
4. **Agent Core:** Sends prompts, parses actions, and invokes tools.  
5. **Tools:** Specialized modules for pathfinding and puzzle solving.  
6. **Action Executor & Logger:** Executes inputs and records state.  
7. **Data & Monitoring:** Logs data and exposes metrics.

## Development & Implementation Plan (Augmented)

- **ROM Validation:** Verify legality with checksum.
- **Precise Memory Mapping:** Replace placeholder addresses and implement helper methods.
- **State Detection:** Implement FSM and unit tests.
- **Prompt & Context Management:** Add summarisation, compression, and hallucination critique.
- **Agent Core Enhancements:** Schema enforcement, fallback parsing, and tool invocation.
- **Control Loop & Performance:** Integrate frame skipping and concurrency safety.
- **Logging & Database:** Track goals, tool calls, and errors. Enable checkpointing.
- **Dashboard & Metrics:** Add state visualization and goal tracking.
- **Testing:** Unit, integration, and stress testing.

## Evaluation & Success Criteria

- **Autonomous Completion:** Defeat the Elite Four without manual input.  
- **Decision Accuracy:** >99.5% valid actions with meaningful reasoning.  
- **Performance:** ≤300 hours runtime, ≥10× speed headless.  
- **State Detection Accuracy:** >95% FSM accuracy.  
- **Stability:** No crashes during 48-hour runs.  
- **Observability:** Clear logs, dashboards, and metrics.

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| ROM Legality | Require user-provided ROM and verify checksum |
| Incorrect Memory Mapping | Research, unit tests, and override configuration |
| Model Hallucinations | Frequent summarisation and explicit ignore instructions |
| Long-Run Degradation | Context compression and checkpoint recovery |
| Performance Bottlenecks | Frame skipping and headless mode |
| API Failures | Retries, action caching, and heuristic defaults |
| Tool Complexity | Start simple and expand incrementally |

## Future Considerations

- **Model Upgrades:** Use newer Mistral or Gemini models.
- **Reinforcement Learning:** Fine-tune with gameplay data.
- **Other Games:** Extend to additional Game Boy titles.
- **Community Interaction:** Add dashboard interaction or live chat (optional).
- **Hardware Acceleration:** Explore GPU-based emulation or inference.

## Conclusion

This PRD focuses on building a robust, autonomous AI agent that completes Pokémon Blue using accurate RAM mapping, state detection, intelligent prompt management, and structured Mistral outputs. Streaming and viewer engagement are secondary. The primary measure of success is the agent’s ability to play the game **efficiently and reliably from start to finish**.

With modular design, comprehensive monitoring, and rigorous testing, this project aims to **advance the state of AI-driven gameplay** and serve as a foundation for future research and applications.
