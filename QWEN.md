# Pokestral - Pok√©mon Blue AI Agent

## Project Overview

Pokestral is a fully autonomous AI agent that plays Pok√©mon Blue from start to finish using the Mistral language model, PyBoy Game Boy emulator, and specialized tools for gameplay automation. The system is designed to complete the game in under 300 hours with >99.5% valid actions while maintaining context length under 10k tokens.

### üéâ CURRENT STATUS: **FULLY OPERATIONAL!**

The system is now successfully integrated and running! The AI agent:
- ‚úÖ Loads and runs Pok√©mon Blue ROM
- ‚úÖ Connects to Mistral API for decision making  
- ‚úÖ Sends proper button inputs to navigate menus and gameplay
- ‚úÖ Receives intelligent responses and executes actions
- ‚úÖ Takes screenshots and saves game progress

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

The Pok√©mon Blue AI Agent consists of several core components that work together to achieve autonomous gameplay:

### 1. Emulator Interface (`emulator/`)
Handles interaction with the PyBoy emulator, including:
- Game loop management with visual display
- Frame skipping and rendering optimization  
- Input injection using new PyBoy API (button_press/button_release)
- Memory access and screenshot capture
- Error handling and graceful shutdown

### 2. Memory Map (`memory_map/`)
Provides access to game state through RAM addresses:
- Party Pok√©mon data extraction
- Player position and status monitoring
- Battle state detection
- Inventory and money tracking
- Game progress flags monitoring

### 3. State Detector (`state_detector/`)
Implements finite state machine for game context:
- Title screen detection
- Overworld navigation state
- Battle state identification
- Menu navigation tracking
- Dialog handling recognition
- Special locations (Pok√© Centers, Marts)

### 4. Agent Core (`agent_core/`)
Main decision-making loop that:
- Queries game state through emulator integration
- Builds context for Mistral API
- Processes API responses with JSON parsing
- Executes actions through emulator interface
- Manages tool usage and coordination

### 5. Prompt Manager (`prompt_manager/`)
Handles context and prompt construction:
- Maintains action history and game state
- Manages context window size optimization
- Compresses old information for efficiency
- Validates responses and formats for API

### 6. Tools (`tools/`)
Specialized modules for game tasks:
- **Battle Helper**: Intelligent combat decision making
- **Pathfinder**: Navigation and movement planning
- **Puzzle Solver**: Game challenge solutions

### 7. Mistral API Integration (`agent_core/mistral_api.py`)
Handles communication with Mistral language model:
- JSON schema for structured requests and responses
- Rate limiting and error handling
- Retry mechanisms for reliability
- Tool calling convention support

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### System Requirements
- Python 3.12+
- 16GB RAM recommended
- Modern CPU with good single-thread performance
- Stable internet connection for Mistral API access

### Installation

#### Using uv (recommended)
```bash
# Install uv if you don't have it
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Create virtual environment and install dependencies
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Using pip
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configuration

1. Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:

```ini
MISTRAL_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
ROM_PATH=roms/pokemon-blue-version.gb
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```

2. Ensure you have a valid Pok√©mon Blue ROM in the `roms/` directory

### Running the Agent

```bash
# Basic usage
python main.py [--rom PATH] [--headless] [--debug]

# Examples:
python main.py --rom ./roms/pokemon-blue-version.gb
python main.py --headless  # Run without visual window
python main.py --debug     # Enable debug logging
```

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Emulator crashes on startup**
- Ensure you have a valid Pok√©mon Blue ROM
- Verify ROM checksum matches known good values
- Check that all dependencies are installed

**Agent gets stuck in game**
- Increase debug logging to identify state detection issues
- Check memory map for correct address values
- Verify pathfinding algorithms for the current map

**API connection errors**
- Verify your Mistral API key is correct
- Check network connectivity
- Ensure you haven't hit rate limits

**Button input not working**
- Check that PyBoy is properly installed (`pip install pyboy`)
- Verify that the emulator can send inputs to the game
- Ensure the game window has focus for non-headless mode

**Screenshot capture fails**
- Check that the screenshots directory is writable
- Verify that PyBoy can capture screen buffer
- Ensure sufficient disk space is available
